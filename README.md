# AndroidBatteryDog
## Authors
This app was originally created on May 24th, 2009 by Ferenc Hechler 
and was worked on on-and-off for the next couple months, when Gary 
Oberbrunner came in and fixed many of the issues that were present 
in the codebase. Then, in late 2016, Greg Willard took the app's 
codebase, allowed the app to work on newer versions of Android, 
rewrote the UI, and added a couple features to it in order to allow 
it to be once again used as a means of battery life/charging analysis.
